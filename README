This is a modified version of the IRCClient framework by Nathan Ollerenshaw. I’ve rewritten it to allow robust support for arbitrary text encodings, and fixed various other problems. The original version is available here: http://sourceforge.net/projects/libircclient/ (distributed alongside the libircclient library).
