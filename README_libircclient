Before you can add IRCClient to your project, you must build libircclient and add it to IRCClient.
(these instructions apply to Xcode 7.1.1, build 7B1005)

0. Download the libircclient source

1. Create a folder called “libircclient” in the IRCClient project folder

2. Build libircclient, according the instructions provided

3. Place the library (libircclient.a) and the headers (libircclient.h, libirc_errors.h, libirc_events.h, libirc_options.h, and libirc_rfcnumeric.h) into the libircclient folder you created

4. Open IRCClient.xcodeproj in Xcode and use “File -> Add Files…” to add the libircclient folder to the project

5. Configure the build phases for the IRCClient framework target by adding libircclient.a to the “Link Binary With Libraries” build phase

6. Close the project

Now you can proceed with step 1 of the instructions in the main README file.
